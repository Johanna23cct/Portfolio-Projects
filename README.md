## Project Overview
This is my portfolio and CV project, showcasing my qualifications, education, and experience as a Data Analysis student at CCT College.

## Motivation
I created this project Remembering the way in which a computer scientist looked for a job years ago, and comparing it to today. I immediately wanted to be in that pool of human talent to feel part of the great Python community and at the same time have something interesting to demonstrate my skills and qualifications to potential employers and collaborators.
